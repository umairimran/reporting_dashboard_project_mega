We need to create a dashboard website.

this website will get data from three different methods.

1. Surfside:

   - Data will be pulled from surfside into backend of our application in s3 and we will get data from there and display it. A sample csv is given to understand what kind of data will be available.

2. Vibe:

   - The data from VIBE will be fetched through their API. See [documentation](https://help.vibe.co/en/articles/8943325-vibe-api-reporting#h_43fb31d027) of how to use their API. A sample API key is provided for testing.

3. facebook:

   - Data will be inserted manually like uploading a csv etc. A sample csv will be given.
