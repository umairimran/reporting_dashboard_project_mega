# **FULL V1 SCOPE OF WORK**

### ***Paid Media Performance Dashboard (V1)***

\\

# **1\. Project Summary**

The Paid Media Performance Dashboard will allow Stephen’s clients to securely log in and view their campaign performance data in a modern, intuitive SaaS interface. Data will be delivered daily via S3, ingested into a database, recalculated according to client-specific CPM values, and visualized across campaign, strategy, placement, and creative levels.

V1 will combine all functionality originally outlined in Phase 1 and Phase 2\.

# **2\. V1 Deliverables (Phase 1 \+ Phase 2 Combined)**

Below is the complete functionality included in the V1 build.

## **2.1 Data Ingestion & Processing**

### **Daily S3 Ingestion (Required)**

* Automated pull of daily CSV files from Stephen’s S3 bucket  
* Scheduled run (approx. 3–4 AM EST)  
* Full ingestion pipeline:

  * File retrieval  
  * Validation  
  * Parsing  
  * Transformation  
  * Storage

### **Weekly \+ Monthly Summary Pipelines**

* Automated weekly summary creation  
* Automated monthly summary creation

### **Historical Import**

* One-time ingestion of historical files provided in S3

## **2.2 Data Transformation Logic**

### **Client-Specific CPM Calculation**

Incoming data uses a default CPM rate ($17).  
 For each client, their custom CPM replaces the default, and spend is recalculated:

**Spend \= (Impressions / 1,000) × Client CPM**

Because of this:

* Spend is affected  
* CPC, CPA, and ROAS (if displayed) use recalculated spend  
* CTR, impressions, clicks, conversions, and revenue remain unchanged

### **Derived Metrics Included in V1**

* Spend (adjusted)  
* CPC  
* CPA

* CTR (Clicks / Impressions)
